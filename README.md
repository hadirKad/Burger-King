### Hi GitHub community 👋
I designed and developed a Flutter UI app for a burger restaurant called ***burger_king***.
    
### 🔭 key features
-----
 - User-friendly interface.
 - A menu section showcasing burgers, sides, and drinks.
 - A search feature for easy navigation through the menu.
 - A well-organized code that's now available on GitHub for anyone interested in learning Flutter.
